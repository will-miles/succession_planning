      <h3>Succession Planning</h3>
      <p>
        Family farming businesses have so much to offer everyone in the family,
        a tightly woven team that supports each other and takes enormous pride
        in the achievements of every individual and the business as a whole.
        <br />
        <br />
        The blood, sweat and tears that go into forging a family business over
        generations builds an incredible bond between the land and those who
        farm it.
        <br />
        <br />
        The topic of Succession within these family farms would on the outside
        appear innocuous – but this is very often not the case. How can it be
        that such a strong family unit can find itself torn apart by something
        that will make them stronger, more resilient and unlock potential for
        the future success of the business and all involved?
        <br />
        <br />
        It is frequently the case that a while we work and live together as
        families we are not always open to talk about the more sensitive things,
        for example
        <br />
        <ul>
          <li>
            When will Grandad/Dad/Mum start to let go and give me a chance?
          </li>
          <li>Will I ever be paid for the work have put into the business?</li>
          <li>How do I tell my parents I don’t want to farm?</li>
          <li>My eldest sibling doesn’t want to farm – but I do!</li>
          <li>
            How can I divide the assets fairly when not all my children want to
            farm?
          </li>
          <li>
            What do I do with the farm if this next generation don’t want to
            farm?
          </li>
        </ul>
        This becomes the elephant in the room and woe betide anyone who dares to
        ‘that topic’. The merest suggestion of change put forward, however
        small, can result in misunderstanding, resentments and communication
        breakdown.
        <br />
        <br />
        Lets face it, no one really want to contemplate much less talk about
        death, but by not making a Succession plan we leave our precious family
        to make all these important decisions when you have gone and they are
        grieving. Surely this is not what we want for our loved ones?
        <br />
        <br />
        Unfortunately it will come to us all and use is that ASSUMPTIONS were
        made by all members of the family – but that each assumption was
        different, and each assumed the other knew what they had assumed.
        Confused?? So are they!
        <br />
        <br />
        They are not only confused but are very upset and when emotions run from
        0-10 reasoning is not easy to do.
        <br />
        <br />
        Change is constant – look at the weather! that is the genetics of a
        dairy herd built over generations, the soil on the land your grandfather
        first tilled – the range of opportunities are vast and the pride It is
        hard to find a topic that can unlock so many raw emotions than the one
        of Succession, and since in the world of agriculture we tend to find it
        and yet it is the main barrier to farming businesses reaching their
        potential
